### Project Description
Chaattapeeli (‡¥ö‡¥æ‡¥ü‡µç‡¥ü‡¥™‡µç‡¥™‡µÄ‡¥≤‡¥ø), which translates to "Whip," is a web-based, voice-interactive AI companion. It features an animated character who listens to a user's spoken input in either Malayalam or English. The application then leverages a generative AI to provide a witty, sarcastic comeback in the same language, delivering the response as both text within a modal and as synthesized audio.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In a world filled with overly polite and relentlessly helpful AI assistants, there's a glaring void for a digital companion that doesn't just serve but judges. Users are drowning in a sea of "Certainly, how can I help you?". They secretly yearn for an AI that listens to their deepest thoughts and responds with the sharp, witty, and lovingly sarcastic retort they truly deserve.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Enter Chaattapeeli, the digital embodiment of a quintessential Keralite aunt with a sharp tongue and a heart of... well, something. This application provides the vital service of taking your spoken words, transcribing them, and using the powerful Gemini AI to generate a fittingly sarcastic comeback. It then speaks the response back to you, all while an animated character visibly judges your life choices.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- [Languages used: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS]
- [Frameworks used: Flask, Flask-SocketIO]
- [Libraries used Key Libraries Used:
Backend: google-generativeai, speech_recognition, gTTS, python-dotenv
Frontend: socket.io-client
External APIs: Google Gemini 1.5 Flash, Google Speech Recognition
- [ffmpeg for audio format conversion]

For Hardware:
- [List main components]
- [List specifications]
- [List tools required]

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
[commands]
Installation
Clone the repository and navigate into the directory.
Bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
Create and activate a Python virtual environment.
Bash
# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

On macOS (via Homebrew): brew install ffmpeg

On Debian/Ubuntu: sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg
# For Windows
python -m venv venv

.\venv\Scripts\activate

Install ffmpeg. This is a crucial dependency for audio processing.

On Windows: Download from the official website and add the bin directory to your system's PATH.

Install the required Python packages.
Bash

pip install Flask Flask-SocketIO google-generativeai SpeechRecognition python-dotenv gTTS

Create an environment file.

Create a file named .env in the root of the project directory.

Add your Google Gemini API key to this file:=
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"


# Run
Start the Flask backend server. Bash python app.py

You should see output indicating the server is running on http://127.0.0.1:5000. Launch the frontend.

Open the index.html file directly in a modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

The browser will ask for microphone permission; you must allow it for the application to work.
