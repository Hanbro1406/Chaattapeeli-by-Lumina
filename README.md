# [Chaattapeeli] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [Lumina]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Hansel T Jaison] - [Albertian Institute of Science & Technology]

### Project Description
Chaattapeeli (‡¥ö‡¥æ‡¥ü‡µç‡¥ü‡¥™‡µç‡¥™‡µÄ‡¥≤‡¥ø), which translates to "Whip," is a web-based, voice-interactive AI companion. It features an animated character who listens to a user's spoken input in either Malayalam or English. The application then leverages a generative AI to provide a witty, sarcastic comeback in the same language, delivering the response as both text within a modal and as synthesized audio.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In a world filled with overly polite and relentlessly helpful AI assistants, there's a glaring void for a digital companion that doesn't just serve but judges. Users are drowning in a sea of "Certainly, how can I help you?". They secretly yearn for an AI that listens to their deepest thoughts and responds with the sharp, witty, and lovingly sarcastic retort they truly deserve.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Enter Chaattapeeli, the digital embodiment of a quintessential Keralite aunt with a sharp tongue and a heart of... well, something. This application provides the vital service of taking your spoken words, transcribing them, and using the powerful Gemini AI to generate a fittingly sarcastic comeback. It then speaks the response back to you, all while an animated character visibly judges your life choices.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- [Languages used: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS]
- [Frameworks used: Flask, Flask-SocketIO]
- [Libraries used Key Libraries Used:
Backend: google-generativeai, speech_recognition, gTTS, python-dotenv
Frontend: socket.io-client
External APIs: Google Gemini 1.5 Flash, Google Speech Recognition
- [ffmpeg for audio format conversion]

For Hardware:
- no specific hardware required. A Browser can run it.

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
[commands]
Installation
Clone the repository and navigate into the directory.
Bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
Create and activate a Python virtual environment.
Bash
# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

On macOS (via Homebrew): brew install ffmpeg

On Debian/Ubuntu: sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg
# For Windows
python -m venv venv

.\venv\Scripts\activate

Install ffmpeg. This is a crucial dependency for audio processing.

On Windows: Download from the official website and add the bin directory to your system's PATH.

Install the required Python packages.
Bash

pip install Flask Flask-SocketIO google-generativeai SpeechRecognition python-dotenv gTTS

Create an environment file.

Create a file named .env in the root of the project directory.

Add your Google Gemini API key to this file:=
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"


# Run
Start the Flask backend server. Bash python app.py

You should see output indicating the server is running on http://127.0.0.1:5000. Launch the frontend.

Open the index.html file directly in a modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

The browser will ask for microphone permission; you must allow it for the application to work.

    Note:
    Due to some technical issues, we were unable to deploy it successfully. We have deployed it on Vercel, but it doesn't support Flutter (backend). The front end can be viewed through https://chaattapeeli-by-lumina.vercel.app/
